# Pneumonia Detection using CNN (Chest X-Ray)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
A simple Streamlit app is included so you can upload an image and get a prediction.

## How to Run the Frontend (Streamlit App)

Open **Command Prompt (CMD)**
Go to the folder where `app.py` is located:

```bash
cd your/folder/path   # press Enter

streamlit run app.py  # press Enter
